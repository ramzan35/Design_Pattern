What is factory pattern
=======================

When a method returns one of several possible classes that shares a common super class.
    Create a new enemy game.
    Random number generator picks a number assigned to a specific enemy.
    The Factory returns the enemy associated with that number.

The class is chosen at run time.

When to use a factory pattern

When you don't know ahead of time what class object you need.
When all of the potential classes are in the same subclass hierarchy
To centralize class section code
When you don't want the use to have to know every subclass
To encapsulate object creation
